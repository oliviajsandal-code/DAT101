      <li>In part 1, is it possible to solve the problem using a single "for" loop?</li>
      <p>Yes, but it is easier to use two for loops, one for counting up and one for counting down.</p>
      <li>In part 2, can we create what is known as an "infinite" loop within the condition of the "while" loop? Describe what would or would not be necessary to achieve this. Provide a thorough explanation ofyour answer.</li>
      <p>Yes, if the guessed number never changes to the correct one, the loop will run forever.</p>
      <li>Discuss briefly how quickly or slowly a computer might be able to compute this, considering the number of guesses and the time it takes. How does the program behave while it is guessing? Canthe program perform other tasks concurrently?</li>
      <p>It can be fast or slow because the guesses are random. While it is guessing, the program is busy and cannot do other tasks at the same time.</p>
      <li>Explain the relationship between rows and columns in nested "for" loops. Can we, for instance, change the order, considering rows to be innermost or columns to be innermost, or does this not matter?</li>
      <p>Rows are the outer loop and columns are the inner loop. You can swap them, but the printed order will change.</p>
