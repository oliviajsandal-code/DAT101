      <li>Discuss the behavior of part 1, What happens when the wake-up time is not 7 and what happens when it is exactly 7?</li>
      <p>If the wake up time is not 7, nothing happens. if it is exactly 7, it prints that you can take the bus to school.</p>
      <li>Same as question #1. How ever the answer should now be different. Discuss the behavior of part 2, What happens when the wake-up time is not 7 and what happens when it is exactly 7?</li>
      <p>If the wake up time is not 7, it prints that you must take the car. if it is exactly 7, it prints that you take the bus to school.</p>
      <li>Discuss the behavior of part 3, what happens when wake time is less than 7 or greater than 8?</li>
      <p>if the wake up time is less than 7 or greater than 8, it prints that you have to take the car to school.</p>
      <li>Discuss the behavior for part 4, what happens if the number is exactly 0, is zero positive or negative?</li>
      <p>If the number is exactly 0, it is neither positive nor negative. it is "Zero".</p>
