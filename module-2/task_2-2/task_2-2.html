      <li>Where should you use constants, and where should you use variables? Can they all be constants?</li>
      <p>
				Use constants for values that never change in your program.
        Use variables for values that can change while the program is running.
        Not all values can be constants, because some values need to be changable when the program runs. 
			</p>
      <li>How do parentheses affect the arithmetic outcome of an expression?</li>
      <p>
				Parenthesis tell the program which part to calculate first.
        This can change the result, because it changes the order of the math.
			</p>
      <li>How do we limit floating-point numbers to a given number of decimals?</li>
      <p>
				We can round or format the number by using commands like toFixed(n) where n is the number of decimals we want.
			</p>
      <li>How can we compare two floating-point values to see if they are equal (is 12.199999 the same as 12.2)?</li>
      <p>
				Floating-point numbers are not always exact, so we check if the difference between them is very small by using the command Math.abs(a - b) < epsilon.
			</p>
      <li>What do comparison operators return, and how can we check if they are FALSE or TRUE?</li>
      <p>
				They return true or false. 
        We can check the result by printing or using it in an "if" statement.
			</p>
      <li>How does the Math.random() function work, and what can it be used for?</li>
      <p>
        Math.random() gives a random number betweeen two defined values. 
        We use it when we need something random, like picking a random number, making a simple game, or choosing a random item. 
			</p>
      <li>What is modulus (%), and when do we need this operator in mathematical operations?</li>
      <p>
				Modulus % gives the remainder after dividing two numbers.
        We use it to check things like whether a number is even or odd, or when we need to loop through values in a repeating pattern.
